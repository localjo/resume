# Passionate

I'm passionate about many things both professionally and personally.

My passion for work can be seen in [my portfolio](http://josiahsprague.com), the contributions graph on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/localjo), [my GitHub repos](https://github.com/localjo?tab=repositories), and [the list of repositories I've contributed to](contributions.png).

My passion for connecting with people is expressed by attending meetups and conferences around the world to make genuine personal and professional connections. I maintain active connections with people around the US, and in the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, Honduras, Canada, Cuba, Italy, Germany, The Republic of Georgia, Indonesia, Romania, the Netherlands and Spain. (I've sadly lost touch with many more people in other places).

And my passion for making a difference in the world is show by [my experience](README.md) volunteering for non-profits and [my contributions at NASA](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/graphs/contributors?from=2017-07-29&to=2018-01-27&type=c).
