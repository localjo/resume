## Why I Love Mapbox

I first heard about Mapbox from some friends in Cuba's open source mapping community when I was visiting an the Historian's Office in Old Havana and saw a Mapbox sticker on their Christmas tree. **I love the fact that Mapbox is creating open source software that's useful for my friends around the world.**

Last week, while talking to a co-worker at NASA Goddard about looking for a job with good company culture, she recommended that I check out Mapbox. She said **Mapbox is highly rated for cultivating a positive working environment, mentorship and equal opportunities** for men and women and she said that she thought it might be exactly what I'm looking for.

So I decided to check out your careers page, and I *loved* what I saw! **The culture of open communication, empathy, valuing diverse perspectives, constant learning, and a passion for building great things really resonates with me!** The Senior Frontend role you're looking to fill fits well with my skills and experience, and the fact that you have Sales Engineer opportunites is something that interests me as well, since I'd like to transition into software sales in the next few years.
