# Diverse Perspective

I've been incredibly fortunate and privileged in my life. The primary way I diversify my perspective is by listening to folks who are different than myself with empathy and respect and trying to put myself in their shoes. In addition, I've had many experiences myself that have given me a diverse perspecetive, including;
