# Diverse Perspective

I've been incredibly fortunate and privileged in my life, and I'm very aware of that fact. I believe very strongly that diversity matters and I make a constant intentional effort to diversify my perspective by listening to folks who are different than myself with empathy and respect and trying to put myself in their shoes.

In addition, I've had many experiences myself that have given me a diverse perspecetive, including;

- Working or volunteering for companies and clients in a variety of industries including technology, sales, real estate, service, advertisting, recruiting, e-commerce, education, non-profit, medical, aerospace, entertainment, television, radio, music, sports, environment, science, government
- Growing up in the Rust Belt, learning the values of hard work and perserverance
- Living in the Dominican Republic, learning Spanish, becoming more aware of my privilege, and learning how to be happy with less
- Living with environmental activists who taught me respect for the planet and animals as well as the value of eating vegan or vegetarian
- Traveling to 26 countries (and counting) and engaging with local people to learn about their languages, cultures, politics, spirituality, sexuality, cuisine, values, experiences and perspectives
