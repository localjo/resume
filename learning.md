# Constant Learner

Since my earliest memories as a kid, I've been driven by curiousity about the world. I grew up asking my parents questions about everything from "Why is the sky blue?" to "Can I take apart the computer?".

On top of my natural curiousity, for two years in middle school I was taught at home which instilled the value of self-motivated learning and discovery early on.

In high school and college, I taught myself how to program and develop web apps. And though I owe a lot to people who have supported me, made resources available to me, and given me opportunities to learn and grow, at least 2/3 of what I know about application development is knowledge that I pursued myself.

Outside of professional knowledge, I have insatiable curiosity for learning about the world. I've made it a point to read [books from authors around the world](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16700342-jo?shelf=read&sort=avg_rating) (and to make sure I break out of the British/American bubble of English writing).

And my natural curiosity has enabled me to become fluent in Spanish in less than two years, to become conversational in Italian in six weeks, to become conversational in Portuguese in two weeks, and to learn the basics of how to greet people, navigate a city and order food in German, Croatian, Georgian and Bahasa Indonesia. I'm currently on a mission to learn Hungarian, one of the most difficult languages in the world
