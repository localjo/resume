# Highly Productive

My productivity can be seen in [my portfolio](http://josiahsprague.com), the contributions graph on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/localjo), [my GitHub repos](https://github.com/localjo?tab=repositories), [the list of repositories I've contributed to](contributions.png) and most recently in [my contributions at NASA](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/graphs/contributors?from=2017-07-29&to=2018-01-27&type=c).

While I strive to be a "10x developer" on a team, and my contributions often show that, I don't like to use the term because it implies that working in isolation is the most productive way to work. But being a productive senior member of the team is  about encouraging and enable other members of a team to be productive through mentorship, support and creating tools that make everyone's job more efficient.
