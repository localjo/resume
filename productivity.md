# Highly Productive

I am a highly productive worker. At times, I've felt that I'm the "10x developer" on a team, but I don't like to use that term because it implies that working in isolation is the most productive, but I'm more concerned about the productivity of the team as a whole. My own output is not the only factor in my productivity. It is also important to encourage and enable other members of a team to be more productive through mentorship, support and creating tools that make everyone's job more efficient.

That being said, my own output is usually very high. My productivity can be seen in [my portfolio](http://josiahsprague.com), the contributions graph on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/localjo), [my GitHub repos](https://github.com/localjo?tab=repositories), [the list of repositories I've contributed to](contributions.png) and most recently in [my contributions at NASA](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/graphs/contributors?from=2017-07-29&to=2018-01-27&type=c).
